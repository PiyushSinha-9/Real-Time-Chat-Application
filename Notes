-> installing express socket.io moment
        moment -> it is moment js used to format date and time
-> install nodemon
        package.json -> scripts -> add "start":'nodemon index.js'
-> public -> index.html -> only thing in body is div with id named 'root', basically we want to
     target that
-> React router wasnt really necessary we could have used redux, just to simplify things
-> Http request are slow compared to socket.io. user socket.io for real time only

-> hooks, new addition in react, we can use life cycle methods, convert class based component to 
    functional based components, heavy use in this projects

-> I think life cycle in hooks is basically when user sign in and when leave, we have to initate
    an function called cleanup

-> in chat.js adding location in const app, we were able to fetch input from join.js

-> ES6 - Syntax in used in chat.js to emit a socket

-> users.js in server manage user sign in, signout, adding, etc.

-> what socket.broadcast does it sends message to everyone besides that user.
